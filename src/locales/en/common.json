The door will automatically lock when you leave. With the key in the key box you can open the canteen (code 1971). After finishing, clean everything up neatly and pull down the canteen roller blind and also turn off the lighting in the canteen. Put the canteen key back in the key box. The light in the hall automatically turns off after the booked playing time. Remove the pin and close the outside door, check that the doors of both halls are locked.",

        "description": "House Rules\n\nPPA is not a company, but an association, and the members are jointly responsible for the atmosphere, accessibility and materials used. This makes it natural that as a member you have a number of responsibilities and adhere to a number of reasonable rules.\n\nSocial\n- When it's busy, it's everyone's responsibility to make room or step aside for a moment. If someone sits on the sideline for 15 minutes, then those who have been playing the longest make room for that player(s). This means that if you make room, someone else will make room for you.\n- Members who come multiple times a week give sufficient space to members who come less often.\n- If you register for competition, you are also responsible for hall and bar duty according to the schedule. You arrange this with your teammates, or you find someone in your area for a fun and rewarding volunteer service.\n- For competition matches, the hall may be used as far as necessary for the match (also for warming up and if a match continues on two tables). The rest of the hall is available for other members.\n\nEquipment\n- Handle the materials with care, take your time to put away a table properly. Store the nets neatly as shown in the instructions. If we handle the equipment carefully, we don't have to replace these expensive items as often and we can keep the membership fee low.\n- You must always close the net in front of the equipment storage and place screens in front of it before you start playing.\n- Retrieve balls from the equipment storage. After (youth) training, a few members are designated to clean up the balls.\n- When you're done playing and there's no one else playing on your table, you clean up that table.\n- If you're physically unable to clean up a table, or don't know how to do it, ask someone to help. We help each other.\n- Balls are not meant to be rolled under a shoe (like a soccer player).\n- You may not sit on the tables.\n- Table tennis balls are not intended for pelting each other (from close range or further away). That's a different sport.\n- After training, participants ensure all balls in the hall and equipment storage are cleaned up.\n- After using the hall, the last users clean up all balls (also in equipment storage), open the equipment storage net, put all tables and screens back neatly, bring the flag inside, lock the hall with QR code (both halls!)",
