Because Ping Pong Alkmaar wants to be as accessible as possible, we offer a membership that includes flexibility and freedom. The first 3 trial lessons are free. The Alkmaar pass can also be used for further membership fees and where necessary we can assist with options regarding payment of the membership fee. Ping Pong Alkmaar is unique in that, in addition to our regular membership options, we also provide a “pay & play” system. In other words, juniors can come and train without a membership for 3.50 euros and adults 7.50 euros per session. In addition, we offer a six-month or yearly membership see below costs.
